### Aim: To design an AI-powered chatbot that assists customers in resolving issues related to product troubleshooting, order tracking, and general inquiries. The chatbot should handle various customer queries efficiently while maintaining a conversational and user-friendly tone. In this experiment, we will employ different prompt patterns to guide the development process of the chatbot, ranging from basic task-oriented prompts to more complex, persona-driven prompts.

### Algorithm:

      What’s the status of my order?
 Chatbot Response
     Your order is currently being processed and will be delivered by September 2nd.
```
## Contextual Prompting
```
Customer Query
Can you check the status? (after saying order not received)
Chatbot Response
I see that you mentioned your order hasn't arrived yet. Let me check the details for you and get back shortly.
```
## Persona-Based Prompting

My laptop fan is making a loud noise.
Chatbot Response
Let’s troubleshoot this together: 1) Are you using it on a soft surface? 2) Try placing it on a hard, flat surface. 3) Have you cleaned the vents? 4) Restart and check again.
```
## Instruction with Constraints
